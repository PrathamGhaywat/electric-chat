# Electric Chat - Multi-API AI Assistant

## Project Vision
Build a comprehensive AI assistant that can interact with multiple APIs and services through natural language, using OpenRouter for AI capabilities and Appwrite as the unified backend for Auth, Database, Storage, and Realtime. Integrations include Notion, Google, GitHub, Slack, and more.

## Core Concept
- **One Interface**: Single chat interface for all your digital tools
- **Natural Language**: Talk to your apps like talking to a person
- **Multi-Modal**: Handle text, images, files, and structured data
- **Context Aware**: Remembers previous interactions and user preferences
- **Action-Oriented**: Not just answers, but actual task execution
- **Build Your Own Agents**: Create custom AI agents with tools, memory, and rules

## Target User Experience
```
User: "Add a meeting with John tomorrow at 3pm and create a Notion page for the project notes"
Assistant: 
‚úì Created calendar event "Meeting with John" for Dec 9, 2025 at 3:00 PM
‚úì Created Notion page "Project Notes - Meeting with John" in your workspace
üìÖ Calendar link: [View Event]
üìù Notion page: [Open Page]
```

## Key Differentiators
1. **Action-First**: Actually performs tasks, not just provides information
2. **Unified Interface**: One chat for all your tools
3. **Context Preservation**: Remembers what you're working on across sessions
4. **Smart Routing**: AI determines which APIs to use based on intent
5. **Real-time Updates**: Live status of ongoing operations (Appwrite Realtime)
6. **Custom Agents**: Users can design, save, and share their own AI agents
